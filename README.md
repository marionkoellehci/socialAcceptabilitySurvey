# Social Acceptability in HCI

This is an accompanying repository to the ACM CHI 2020 paper **"Social Acceptability in HCI: A Survey of Methods, Measures, and Design Strategies"** by Marion Koelle, Swamy Ananthanarayan, and Susanne Boll. 

## Analysis

We anaylzed current research practices around social acceptability in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). For the CHI 2020 paper, we considered works between 2000 and 2018. In the future, we aim to extend, and continously update the tagged data set to also include papers from 2019 onwards.

### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

The analysis (and tagged dataset) comprises papers that meet the following inclusion criteria: 
1. The work is original, peer-reviewed research. 
2. The work (a) contains a formal or informal evaluation or measurement of social acceptability, or (b) names social acceptability as design goal for a presented prototype or interface, or (c) names design recommendations for socially acceptable interfaces. 
3. The work covers the social acceptability (from user and/or spectator perspective) of a user's interaction with a system, interface or technology.

### Tagging Scheme

We provide information on the tagging scheme at https://github.com/marionkoellehci/socialAcceptabilitySurvey/wiki/Dataset.

### Analyzed Papers as Tagged Dataset

We provide the set of analyzed papers as tagged dataset, following the example of Frederik Brudy's [Cross-device Taxonomy Dataset](https://github.com/frederikbrudy/cross-device-taxonomy/); so that it could be used along with [PaperTag](https://github.com/christianholz/papertag/).

All bibtex data is located at `data/bibtex` and organized into one file for works comprised by the 2020 CHI paper, and one including continous updates. The corresponding tags (one file per paper) are located at
`data/tags`. So far, not all aspects covered by the CHI 2020 paper are included as tags. Tags currently cover methods and measures; Design strategies might be added at a later point.
